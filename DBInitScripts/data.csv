Mental health refers to either a level of cognitive or emotional well-being or an absence of a mental disorder. Mental Health also means the ability to enjoy life’s activities while maintaining a level of balance in the face of life’s ups and downs. The World Health Organization has now defined mental health as “a feeling of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community”. Mental health is an expression of our emotions and signifies a successful adaptation to a variety of situational demands allowing us to maintain our full potential and participate successfully in everyday life.","","24/7 or does not apply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

Harmful physical and emotional response that occurs when there is a poor match between job demands and the capabilities, resources, or needs of the worker. Stress is the emotional and physical strain caused by our response to pressure from the outside world. Common stress reactions include tension, irritability, inability to concentrate, and a variety of physical symptoms that include headache and a fast heartbeat.  It’s almost impossible to live without some stress. And most of us wouldn’t want to, because it gives life some spice and excitement.

When stress on the job is interfering with your ability to perform, take care of yourself, or manage your personal life, it’s time to take steps to change things. Start by looking closely at your physical and emotional health. When your physical and emotional health are prioritized and your need are addressed, you’re stronger and more resilient to stress. The healthier you feel, the more equipped you will be to manage work stress.  While some stress is normal in life, excessive stress interferes with your physical and emotional health, so it’s important to find ways to keep it under control. This change does not necessarily mean a total lifestyle switch. Even small things can improve your mood, add energy, and make you feel like you’re healthier and happier. Take one change at a time, and as you make more positive lifestyle choices, you’ll soon notice a greatly reduced stress level, both at home at work.  Below are some easy suggestions that you can try to create a less stressful environment at work:  Avoid too much caffeine, soda pop, and junk. Better yet, stop using them. Don’t procrastinate. You’ll be happy you got it done. Encourage positive self-talk. Don’t get caught up in gossip or negative thinking. Use the stairs for exercise. Avoid nicotine. Smoking when you’re feeling stressed and overwhelmed may seem calming, but nicotine is a powerful stimulant – leading to higher, not lower, levels of anxiety. Do one thing at a time. Eat nourishing food that keeps you going and makes you feel good. Drink water. Change your attitudes. Think of stressful situations as a challenge to your creative thinking. Share work problems. If you encounter an unusually challenging work problem, talk with coworkers. It will help to talk through issues. Sometimes just by talking through a problem, you will find the answer. Know your limits: Be realistic about what you can accomplish and do not put unrealistic workloads and timelines on yourself. Say no when you can’t. Wear comfortable clothes. Find humour. Don’t take everything too seriously; find a way to break through with laughter. Share a joke or funny story. Make “TO DO” lists. List everything you need to do in order of priority. Schedule time for yourself. Stick to the schedule! Take a relaxation break. Eat lunch away from your desk or work area. Try to go home on time. Leave earlier from home in the morning. Running late and hurrying adds stress. Take real weekends and vacations. Avoid thinking about work. Turn off your blackberries and emails after a certain time. The email will wait till tomorrow. Leave your cell phones and emails out of the restaurants. Enjoy your meals without stress. Organize your files and work space so that things can be found quickly. Delegate tasks. Don’t over-commit yourself. Avoid scheduling things back-to-back or trying to fit too much into one day. Stay positive.","MDSC","Definition","Information/Education (user intent: information or learning more about a topic)","","Medium - 5 to 7","Low - 1-4","","","","","","","","","","General Public / All","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Informational (text, document, and/or video for information only)","","","","","","","","","","","Adult (18+)","","","","Canada Wide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Stress","","","","","","Website","","","","","","","","","","",""," www.mdsc.ca)","https://mdsc.ca/workplace/workplace-stress/","","","","","","","24/7 or does not apply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

Mental health is a term that describes how we feel, perceive, think, communicate and understand within the context of our community. Mental health refers to either a level of cognitive or emotional well-being or an absence of a mental disorder. Mental Health also means the ability to enjoy life’s activities while maintaining a level of balance in the face of life’s ups and downs.  It was previously stated that there was no one “official” definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how “mental health” is defined. However, the World Health Organization has now defined mental health as “a feeling of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community”. Mental health is an expression of our emotions and signifies a successful adaptation to a variety of situational demands allowing us to maintain our full potential and participate successfully in everyday life.  Mental health (or well-being) is an ideal we all strive for. It is a balance of mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health. Caring relationships, a place to call home, a supportive community, and work and leisure all contribute to mental health.  However, no one’s life is perfect, so mental health is also about learning the coping skills to deal with life’s ups and downs the best we can.","MDSC","Definition","Information/Education (user intent: information or learning more about a topic)","","Medium - 5 to 7","Low - 1-4","","","","","","","","","","General Public / All","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Informational (text, document, and/or video for information only)","","","","","","","","","","","Adult (18+)","","","","Canada Wide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mental Health in General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Website","","","","","","","","","","","","www.mdsc.ca","https://mdsc.ca/workplace/health-and-wellness-in-the-workplace/","","","","","","","24/7 or does not apply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

Mental illness is a serious disturbance in thoughts, feelings and perceptions that is severe enough to affect day-to-day functioning.

Depression:  Intense feelings of sadness and worthlessness – so bad that you have lost interest in life.  Bi-polar Disorder:  Cycles of feeling intensely happy and invincible followed by depression.  Anxiety Disorders:  Panic attacks, phobias, obsessions or post-traumatic stress disorder.  Eating Disorders:  Anorexia (not eating), or bulimia (eating too much and then vomiting).  Borderline Personality Disorder:  Severe difficulty with relationships, placing yourself in danger, makes decisions that turn out to be very bad for you.  Problem Gambling:  Is an urge to gamble despite harmful negative consequences or a desire to stop. Problem gambling often is defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler’s behaviour.","MDSC","Definition","Information/Education (user intent: information or learning more about a topic)","","Medium - 5 to 7","Low - 1-4","","","","","","","","","","General Public / All","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Informational (text, document, and/or video for information only)","","","","","","","","","","","Adult (18+)","","","","Canada Wide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mental Health in General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Website","","","","","","","","","","","","www.mdsc.ca","https://mdsc.ca/workplace/health-and-wellness-in-the-workplace/","","","","","","","24/7 or does not apply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",

Depression can affect many different areas of your life. As a result, your doctor may recommend specific lifestyle changes that include exercise, nutrition and proper sleep. Another good idea may be to reach out to friends and family for support, as well as taking the time to be social with others.8,11  Engaging in Physical Activity11 Although it may be difficult to start, becoming more physically active may help you manage depression. Regular physical activity is related to improved mental and physical well-being. Recent research indicates that physically fit people are less vulnerable to depression, and that regular exercise can greatly reduce symptoms of depression for many people.  Exercise affects mood in four ways:11  It can produce an immediate elevation in mood after exercising in some people (during depression this effect may not occur) After a few weeks of regular exercise (three to four times a week, at least 20 minutes at a time), a general improvement in mood tends to begin Improvements in physical fitness are associated with improved energy, which can enable you to do more Exercise can be a good way of “burning off” stress when you are feeling tense A Healthy Diet11 Depression is an illness which tends to disrupt appetite. This is why maintaining a balanced diet can prove difficult. But, the potential positive effects of a healthy, balanced diet on overall health and even on depressive condition cannot be overlooked.  Improving Sleep11 Stress, anxiety and depression often have a disruptive effect on sleep, and poor sleep itself can exacerbate anxiety and depression. In other words, sleep disorders are both a cause and effect of mood disorders.  Limiting Alcohol Intake and Avoiding Drug Use (Cannabis or Other Drugs)11 The anguish experienced during depression can prompt the consumption of alcohol or other substances that trigger dependency (such as tobacco, cannabis, amphetamines and cocaine). Initially they may seem soothing, with a tranquilizing or calming effect, but these immediate effects are deceptive: the impression of improvement dissipates quickly and these substances become toxic.","MDSC","Definition","Information/Education (user intent: information or learning more about a topic)","","Medium - 5 to 7","Low - 1-4","","","","","","","","","","General Public / All","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Informational (text, document, and/or video for information only)","","","","","","","","","","","Adult (18+)","","","","Canada Wide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Depression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mood Disorders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Website","","","","","","","","","","",""," www.mdsc.ca","https://depressionhurts.ca/en/manage/healthy-lifestyle/","","","","","","","24/7 or does not apply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",
